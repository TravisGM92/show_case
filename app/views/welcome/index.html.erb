          <h4>"Soft" Skills</h4>
          <p>My last career was in communication, so of course I find soft skills highly valued. I say "soft" rather than soft because I don't consider communication skills to be less important than technical skills. They aren't 'soft', rather, immensely important in most jobs, esepcially programming.</p>

          <h3>Career Goals</h3>
          <p>As a bit of a perfectionist, I'd prefer to develop a really strong base in programming. Because I like keeping up on current events related to tech, I've grown a strong interest for <b>Python</b> and <b>Django</b>.</p><br>
          <p>I'd also love to get into a bit of <b>UX/UI design</b>. As a software developer, it seems quite important to really understand what the client wants. If I don't know any UX/UI principles, how am I to truly understand what the client wants?</p><br>
          <p>I believe a strength of mine is problem solving. I absolutely love all of the things that come with problem solving; <b>debugging</b>, <b>testing</b> (using RSpec, Minitest, Capybara, etc.), and scouring Stack Overflow. However, a weakness of mine is not knowing when to take a break (or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">pom</a>" as we like to say in class). This is something I'd like to improve; the ability to know when I've hit the point of diminishing returns and need to step away.</p>
