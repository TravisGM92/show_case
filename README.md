# README

This project was originally created with the idea that I'd like to keep a record of what I've learned and see how my skills have progressed over time.

There is a testing suite present. In order to clone this project down, one should first make sure they're running on Ruby version 2.5.3, and running on Rails version 5.2.4.3.

In order for you're app to work correctly, you'll need to create a database. So, in the terminal, type the following command; 'rails db:create'.

One of the first things you'll notice is that this website was built on the strict principle of TDD.
